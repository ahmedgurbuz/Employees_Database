# Employees_Database
In this project, the database of employees of the Pewlett Hackard corporation from the 1980s and 1990s is analyzed. Tables are designed to hold data in the CSV and then those CSVs are imported into a SQL database.  Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis skills are performed to derive results.
